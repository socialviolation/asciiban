const Acrobatic = `flf2a$ 12 9 25 0 15 0
Acrobatic by Randy Ransom 8/94 <ransom@scf.usc.edu>
Figlet release 2.1 -- August 12, 1994
Date: 23 Aug 1994

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
12   - height of a character
9    - height of a character, not including descenders
25   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
0    - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 0" on command line)
15   - number of comment lines
0    - rtol

For extra effects try to close the gap between the letters, or use different
fill patterns.

const Alphabet = `flf2a 7 5 10 -1 17
Alphabet by Wendell Hicken 11/93 (whicken@parasoft.com)

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
20   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
12   - number of comment lines

---

Font modified June 17, 2007 by patorjk 
This was to widen the space character.

const Avatar = `flf2a$ 6 5 10 16 16
Avatar by Claude Martins 02/95

Figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
10    - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
16   - default smushmode for this font
16   - number of comment lines

const Banner = `flf2a$ 8 7 54 0 12 0 64 185
banner.flf version 2 by Ryan Youck (youck@cs.uregina.ca)
(From a unix program called banner)
I am not responsible for use of this font  
Thanks to Glenn Chappell for his help
Katakana characters by Vinney Thai <ssfiit@eris.cs.umb.edu>
Cyrillic characters from "koi8x8" BDF font.
Date: August 11, 1994

Merged by John Cowan <cowan@ccil.org>
Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

Lower case letters, punctuation, and miscellaneous changes by Kent Nassen, 
                                                      kentn@cyberspace.org
                                                     Last change: 10/11/94
Upper case letters originally by Joshua Bell:

Newsgroups: alt.ascii-art

Subject: Yet Another Non-Figlet Font
Message-ID: <Mar13.073432.23373@acs.ucalgary.ca>

Organization: The University of Calgary
Lines: 30
Status: RO

I've had this kicking around for a while. If anyone wants to add
in other characters and Figlet-ize it, go right ahead.

const Big = `flf2a$ 8 6 59 15 10 0 24463
Big by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- based on Standard
Includes ISO Latin-1
Greek characters by Bruce Jakeway <pbjakeway@neumann.uwaterloo.ca>
figlet release 2.2 -- November 1996
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

const Bigfig = `flf2a$ 3 3 5 -1 23
Expansion font for bigfig program by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- based on Mini
26 Apr 1995
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

This font is intended to be used with the "bigfig" program. It can
be used as an ordinary figlet font, but it won't look very nice.
"bigfig" is available by anonymous ftp from "ftp.nicoh.com". Look in
the directory "pub/figlet/util".

Or, if you'd rather not use the bigfig program, just type
figlet -w27 -f myfavoritefont | figlet -f bigfig

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
3    - height of a character
3    - height of a character, not including descenders
5    - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font
23   - number of comment lines

const Binary = `flf2a$ 1 1 11 -1 11 0

binary.flf (C) 1994 by Victor Parada (vparada@inf.utfsm.cl) 94/12/05

figlet 2.1 font, includes ISO Latin-1, excludes "-D" option chars.

Spaces are not shown as binary.  If this is required, change "$@" below
to "00100000 @".  Change to "@" to remove the hardspace between words.
Note that figlet always removes spaces when it moves words to a new line.

Try option "-m 0" to remove the space between letters (octets).

Block by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- straight version of Lean
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

Update February 12, 2002 by Markus Gebhard markus@jave.de
  Added german umlauts

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
4    - height of a character
4    - height of a character, not including descenders
99   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
0    - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 0" on command line)
13   - number of comment lines

const Calgphy2 = `flf2a$ 20 16 34 0 30 0
Modified by Paul Burton September 96 from caligraphy.flf as a demonstration of 
FigWin features.  Modification took about 5 minutes using FigWin's "rectangle 
search and replace" feature.  The characters previously consisted of only "*" 
characters.  These changes required two steps:

First, all instances of "*" were replaced with "#" to give the font a darker 
appearance.  

                         #                      /
Then, all instances of: #  were replaced with: /   (Each of these is a 
rectangle of four squares, including two blanks.)

Also added a period, exclamation point, and question mark and changed the 
default smushmode.

Original caligraphy.flf composed by Vinney Thai October 94
 -----------------------------=<< FigWin Hype >>=------------------------------
 These comments were generated automatically by FigWin, not the author of the
 font.  FigWin is the Windows clone of FIGlet with a full featured font editor!
 Forget about doing the math to figure out the smushmode number!  Just check a
 few boxes for each smushing rule.  Forget about endmarks!  Let the computer
 figure out how tall and how wide your font is.  Just draw fonts with the mouse
 and wipe the smudgemarks off your screen from all that counting!

 FigWin is full of features, but it's designed for use by a complete idiot.  If
 you qualify, visit the FigWin website.  Screen shots are shown, and of course
 you will be able to download it.

const Caligraphy2 = `flf2a$ 20 16 34 0 30 0
Modified by Paul Burton September 96 from caligraphy.flf as a demonstration of 
FigWin features.  Modification took about 5 minutes using FigWin's "rectangle 
search and replace" feature.  The characters previously consisted of only "*" 
characters.  These changes required two steps:

First, all instances of "*" were replaced with "#" to give the font a darker 
appearance.  

                         #                      /
Then, all instances of: #  were replaced with: /   (Each of these is a 
rectangle of four squares, including two blanks.)

Also added a period, exclamation point, and question mark and changed the 
default smushmode.

Original caligraphy.flf composed by Vinney Thai October 94
 -----------------------------=<< FigWin Hype >>=------------------------------
 These comments were generated automatically by FigWin, not the author of the
 font.  FigWin is the Windows clone of FIGlet with a full featured font editor!
 Forget about doing the math to figure out the smushmode number!  Just check a
 few boxes for each smushing rule.  Forget about endmarks!  Let the computer
 figure out how tall and how wide your font is.  Just draw fonts with the mouse
 and wipe the smudgemarks off your screen from all that counting!

 FigWin is full of features, but it's designed for use by a complete idiot.  If
 you qualify, visit the FigWin website.  Screen shots are shown, and of course
 you will be able to download it.

const Colossal = `flf2a$ 11 8 20 32 17
Colossal.flf (Jonathon - jon@mq.edu.au)
8 June 1994

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
11   - height of a character
8    - height of a character, not including descenders
20   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
32   - default smushmode for this font
13   - number of comment lines

---

Font modified June 17, 2007 by patorjk 
This was to widen the space character.

const Cricket = `flf2a$ 8 4 14 0 25 0 16256
Cricket by Leslie Bates        Jan. 1, 1996
cricket9@aros.net       http://www.aros.net/~cricket9
I wish to thank Wade Fincher for the SIG that was used as a base for Cricket as
well as Chris Gill who designed the Square font, some of which was used in 
Cricket. And finally I wish to thank Paul Burton, who if it was not for his 
desire to create FIGWin, I may never have had the motivation to create a 
FIGfont.
 FIGWin is the Windows clone of FIGlet with a full featured FIGfont editor!
 Forget about doing the math to figure out the smushmode number.  Just check a
 few boxes for each smushing rule.  Forget about endmarks -- let the computer
 figure out how tall and how wide your font is.  Just draw FIGfonts with the
 mouse and wipe the smudgemarks off your screen from all that counting!

 FIGWin is full of features, but it's designed for use by a complete idiot.  If
 you qualify, visit the FIGWin website.  Screen shots are shown, and of course
 you can download it.  (FREE!)

                      http://home.earthlink.net/~solution

 Also see the FIGlet website:  http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/chai/figlet.html

This was to widen the space character.

const Cursive = `flf2a$ 6 4 20 0 11

Based on cursive(6) by Jan Wolter     <janc@crim.eecs.umich.edu> on 24 Jul 1985
Figlet-ized and     by Wendell Hicken <whicken@parasoft.com>     on  5 Mar 1994
    Added missing punctuation and numbers
Ammended            by Jerrad Pierce  <jpierce@cpan.org>         on  8 Aug 2002
    Underscore and dash have been updated to more closely match cursive(6)

       The  '_' character is treated in a special way.  It may be
       inserted in the text anywhere you wish to lengthen a  con-
       necting line between two letters.

const Cygnet = `flf2a$ 5 4 15 0 11 0 8063 200
Author : Christian 'CeeJay' Jensen
Date   : 2006/5/19
Version: 0.10 beta
-------------------------------------------------
"Cygnet" - A figfont by CeeJay

A cygnet is a baby swan.
The font is named so because it's based on

const DANC4 = `flf2a$ 4 4 48 0 20 0 0
DANC4 by Richard Sabey <cryptic_fan@hotmail.com> 9.2003
    This font is based on the "dancing men" cipher used in Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story "The Adventure of the Dancing Men" (DANC),
which was later published in the collection "The Return of Sherlock Holmes".
    The cipher ignores punctuation, and marks a space by a flag held by the
dancing man for the last letter before the space. The last figure of
an entire message carries no flag, as there is no need for one. In this
implementation of the cipher, figures with no flags represent lowercase
letters; those with flags, uppercase letters. Thus, when FIGletising, you
should type only the letters, and uppercase the *last* letter of every word
except the last. For example "Come, Elsie!" becomes comEelsie.
    The messages in dancing-men cipher in DANC didn't use the letters
FJKQUWXZ. What's more, editions of DANC vary in what mistakes they make in
the cipher, though they are consistent in using the same figure for P & V.
To resolve this problem and supply the missing figures, I follow the TrueType
font designed in 1994 by Martin Bergman of Sweden.
    The positions of the flags have been altered to keep this a 4-line FIGfont.

const DOSRebel = `flf2a$ 11 8 35 -1 14
Rebel by Valerie Mates (popcorn@cyberspace.org), based on a font by Ron Bliss
(who sometimes goes by the name "rebel" because his initials are REB).
May 27, 1994

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
11   - height of a character
8    - height of a character, not including descenders
35   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
14   - number of comment lines

const Decimal = `flf2a$ 1 1 11 -1 12 0

decimal.flf by Karlton Wirsing based on
binary.flf (C) 1994 by Victor Parada (vparada@inf.utfsm.cl) 94/12/05

figlet 2.1 font, includes ISO Latin-1, excludes "-D" option chars.

Spaces are not shown as binary.  If this is required, change "$@" below
to " @".  Change to "@" to remove the hardspace between words.
Note that figlet always removes spaces when it moves words to a new line.

Try option "-m 0" to remove the space between letters (octets).

const DrPepper = `flf2a$ 5 4 20 0 16
Font  : Dr. Pepper (after a name in one sig done in this style).
Author: Eero Tamminen, t150315@cc.tut.fi.

Characters '#' and '&' are lousy and I'm not very satisfied
with the '$' or 't'... Suggestions?

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identifiction
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints s a blank, but can't be smushed
5    - height of a character
4    - height of a character, not including descenders
20    - max line length (excluding comment lines) +  fudge factor
0    - default smushmode for this font
16   - number of comment lines

const Fender = `flf2a$ 7 5 16 -1 12
Fender by Scooter 8/94 (jkratten@law.georgetown.edu)
 
Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
7    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
10   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
12   - number of comment lines

const FourTops = `flf2a$ 4 3 11 0 14
Fourtops by Randall Ransom 4/94 <ransom@girtab.usc.edu>
Figlet release 2.0 -- August 5, 1993
Date: 9 Apr 1994

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
4    - height of a character
3    - height of a character, not including descenders
11   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
0    - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 0" on command line)
14   - number of comment lines

const Georgi16 = `flf2a$ 16 2 25 15 20 0 0
Georgia 16 by Richard Sabey 8.2003
Includes new parameter supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.
To avoid too great a space in "nn", the bottom serifs must touch. Thus, this
font is designed to be figletised so that glyphs may not smush but may abut.
However, heavy characters representing thick strokes need space. Thus this
font extensively uses $ to force a space after a heavy character.
Rows: 1-2 cap-height letters' diacritics
        3 underscores for cap-height serifs
        4 cap-height line
        6 underscores for x-height serifs
        7 x-height line
       13 baseline
    14-16 descenders
31.8.2003 All ASCII and ISO Latin 1's printables.

const Georgia11 = `flf2a$ 11 9 24 0 22 0 64
Georgia 11 by Richard Sabey <cryptic_fan@hotmail.com> 9.2003
Includes new parameter supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.
    Heavy characters representing thick strokes need space. Thus,
this font is designed to be figletised so that FIGcharacters may not
smush but may fit, and it extensively uses $ to force a space after a
heavy character.
    Where serifs fit, it might look as if the FIGletters would look better
with a bit of smushing. However, the spacing forced by the hardblanks
looks no more than what you really get with Georgia; e.g. in "ini" or
"imp", the heavy downstrokes are roughly equally spaced.
Rows: 1-2 cap-height letters' diacritics
        3 cap-height line
        5 x-height line
        9 baseline
    10-11 descenders
For JavE see http://www.jave.de/
3.9.2003 Text rendered as GIF in Paint. GIF ASCIIfied in JavE's image-to-ASCII
         converter with font "Courier New" and Shape factor 1.07
6.9.2003 Added Cyrillic and Greek
7.9.2003 Added ligatures

const Goofy = `flf2a$ 6 6 30 0 22
Explanation of first line:                            *** GoofY 0.1 ***
flf2a - necessary stuff to identify the kind of file
$     - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6     - height of a character
6     - height of a character, not including descenders
30    - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
0     - put characters together, no smushing or whatever, please!
22    - number of comment lines (starting with the 'Explanation' line)

const Gothic = `flf2a$ 9 8 14 -1 16
Gothic.flf - Taken from a banner program called "gothic" by Howard Chu
Figletization suggested bu Bob Bright (bright@cc.umanitoba.ca)
Figletized by Wendell Hicken 11/19/93 (whicken@parasoft.com)
Version 1.1 - updated on 11/23/93
Version 1.11 - updated on 11/28/93 by Brian Tao (taob@io.org)
             - adjusted baseline and fixed some spacing problems
Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
9    - height of a character
8    - height of a character, not including descenders
14   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
16   - number of comment lines

const Graceful = `flf2a$ 4 4 8 0 14 0 8256
Graceful-6x4 by Mikhael Goikhman, http://migo.n3.net/, 20/Jan/2002.

Why did I make this font? Most of the figlet fonts are ugly for my taste.
Chars ".", "'" or "|" are not as graceful as "(", ")", "/", "\" and "_".
Also most of the fonts unlike this one are either small or good, not both.
And finally, I wanted to have a strictly sized font, this one is 6x4.
I intended to create this elegant figlet font in 1996, but only in
January 2002 actually had the time to bring it to the working state. :)
Cyrillic letters are supported, maybe somewhen I will add hebrew latters.
To get a monospaced font 6x4, use "figlet -f graceful -m -1". Enjoy!

Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is added to this comment.

const Greek = `flf2a$ 9 7 13 15 30
NTGreek by Bruce Jakeway--based on Standard by Glenn Chappell & Ian Chai
Questions and comments regarding ntgreek.flf to pbjakeway@neumann.uwaterloo.ca
For figlet release 2.0
Date:  1994 Apr 2

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
9    - height of a character
7    - height of a character, not including descenders
13   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
30   - number of comment lines

Greek keyboard maps:

All keys map to those in standard except:

const Hex = `flf2a$ 1 1 11 -1 12 0

hex.flf by Karlton Wirsing based on
binary.flf (C) 1994 by Victor Parada (vparada@inf.utfsm.cl) 94/12/05

figlet 2.1 font, includes ISO Latin-1, excludes "-D" option chars.

Spaces are not shown as binary.  If this is required, change "$@" below
to "20 @".  Change to "@" to remove the hardspace between words.
Note that figlet always removes spaces when it moves words to a new line.

Try option "-m 0" to remove the space between letters (octets).

Figlet conversion by Kent Nassen (kentn@cyberspace.org), 8-10-94, based
on the fonts posted by Lennert Stock:

From: stock@fwi.uva.nl (Lennert Stock)
Date: 15 Jul 1994 00:04:25 GMT

Here are some fonts. Non-figlet I'm afraid, if you wanna convert them, be
my guest. I posted the isometric fonts before.

Figlet conversion by Kent Nassen (kentn@cyberspace.org), 8-10-94, based
on the fonts posted by Lennert Stock:

From: stock@fwi.uva.nl (Lennert Stock)
Date: 15 Jul 1994 00:04:25 GMT

Here are some fonts. Non-figlet I'm afraid, if you wanna convert them, be
my guest. I posted the isometric fonts before.

const Ivrit = `flf2a$ 6 5 76 15 14 1 16271
Ivrit (Hebrew) Unicode font assembled by John Cowan <cowan@ccil.org>
Latin chars from  Standard by G. Chappell & Ian Chai
Hebrew chars from Jerusalem by Gedaliah Friedenberg <gfrieden@nyx.cs.du.edu>
        Use "ilhebrew.flc" for Hebrew keyboard mapping
        Use "ushebrew.flc" for U.S.-style keyboard mapping ("febrew" script)
        Use "8859-8.flc" for ISO 8859-8 text
        Or use UTF-8
WARNING! FIGfonts aren't bidirectional; this is strictly right-to-left 
        (by default) even for the Latin characters.
figlet release 2.2 -- November 1996

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

const Jerusalem = `flf2a$ 7 6 100 15 31 1
Jerusalem by Gedaliah Friedenberg - based on Standard by G. Chappell & Ian Chai
Questions and comments regarding jerusalem.flf to gfrieden@nyx.cs.du.edu
Modified for figlet 2.1 by Glenn Chappell 16 Dec 1993
Date: 13 Feb 1994

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
7    - height of a character
6    - height of a character, not including descenders
100  -  max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font
31   - number of comment lines
1    - print right-to-left (figlet 2.1 or later only)

Hebrew keyboard maps:

All capital letters print the english character for that key.  All numbers 
and symbols are the same in in Hebrew/English except for those shown here.
The * symbol prints as a Jewish star (Star of David).
While in figlet, type ~ on a line by itself to see this list:

const Lean = `flf2a$ 8 6 27 0 10 0 576
Lean by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- based on various .sig's
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

const Linux = `flf2a$ 4 3 9 -1 13
linux by Larry Smith 5/12/95 - based on .sig of Roberth Karman.
Figlet release 2.0 -- August 5, 1993

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
     - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
4    - height of a character
3    - height of a character, not including descenders
9    - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
13   - number of comment lines

const Maxfour = `flf2a$ 4 3 11 0 13
Maxfour by Randall Ransom 1/94 <suaac@csv.warwick.ac.uk>
Figlet release 2.0 -- August 5, 1993

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
4    - height of a character
3    - height of a character, not including descenders
11   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
0    - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 0" on command line)
13   - number of comment lines

const Mini = `flf2a$ 4 3 10 0 10 0 1920
Mini by Glenn Chappell 4/93
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

Mirror by David Walton <walton@cs.ucdavis.edu>  24 Aug 1994
This is a mirror image version of...
Standard by Glenn Chappell & Ian Chai 3/93 -- based on Frank's .sig

a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
20   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font
18   - number of comment lines

const Mnemonic = `flf2a$ 1 1 12 -1 5 0 0 1797
mnemonic - a FIGfont by John Cowan <cowan@@ccil.org>
This font uses the mnemonics of RFC1345
(http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1345.txt) to implement a really large character
set rather crudely, but reversibly.  Two-letter mnemonics
are prefixed by &; larger mnemonics are prefixed by &_ and followed by _.

const Morse = `flf2a$ 1 1 30 -1 40
Morse by Glenn Chappell <ggc@uiuc.edu> 10/95
Based on info from "Morse Code and the Phonetic Alphabets"
URL: http://www.soton.ac.uk/~scp93ch/refer/alphabet.html
Includes some ISO Latin-1 characters
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Use of this font allows figlet to convert ASCII to International Morse
Code.

The following substitutions have been made, i.e., if figlet receives a
character on the left as input, it will print the Morse Code for the
character on the right:
!               -> .
;               -> :
[]{}            -> ()
German s-z      -> ss
Latin-1 "prime" -> '
#               -> <Delete last word>
*               -> Ch

Except as noted above, characters not available in Morse Code will print
as "?".

Inter-word spaces have been enlarged to improve readability. To conform
to the standards for automatic transmission of Morse Code, use smushmode
zero ("figlet -f morse -m0"); wait the duration of a dot for each blank
in the output, as well as between any two output characters (dots,
dashes or blanks).

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
1    - height of a character
1    - height of a character, not including descenders
30   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font
40   - number of comment lines

const NScript = `flf2a= 16 10 32 1 21
************************** nscript.flf **************************
nscript by Normand Veilleux <nveilleu@emr.ca> Oct 7, 1994
figletized by Peter Samuelson <psamuels@hmc.edu> Nov 29, 1994

Explanation of first line:
flf2a - "magic number" for file identification
=     - hardblank--like a blank, but won't smush
16    - height of a character
10    - height of a character, not including descenders
32    - max line length (after comments) -- currently in "W"
1     - default smushmode for this font
21    - number of comment lines

Note: this font connects smoothly together, and to that end there
are two sets of lowercase letters.  The "normal" set is where
lowercase letters should be, and the "other" set, for use after
lowercase b, o, v and w, replaces what I thought were the least
essential characters in ASCII.  To use these, run your text
through UNIX sed(1) with a long series of replace commands.

******************** and now, the font itself *******************

const NTGreek = `flf2a$ 9 7 13 15 30
NTGreek by Bruce Jakeway--based on Standard by Glenn Chappell & Ian Chai
Questions and comments regarding ntgreek.flf to pbjakeway@neumann.uwaterloo.ca
For figlet release 2.0
Date:  1994 Apr 2

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
9    - height of a character
7    - height of a character, not including descenders
13   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
30   - number of comment lines

Greek keyboard maps:

All keys map to those in standard except:

const NVScript = `flf2a$ 16 10 25 0 32

Script by Normand Veilleux
FIGlet Font compiled by Jerrad Pierce <jpierce@cpan.org>
Prior (independent) conception by Colin Douthwaite

A second set of lowercase characters, with special ligatures,
to follow 'b', 'o', 'v' and 'w' is available. To access them
use the character code 200+the letter of the alphabet
eg; 201 is 'a' 226 is 'z' and 'bomb' is b + 215 + 213 + b

On windows use Alt+# (on the numpad) to enter the code.
For anything else you are on your own.
HINT: perl -e 'print chr(210)' will get you a special j

#The following is applicable for smushmode -1
At times, you will have to delete a portion of the area between
two letters in order for them to connect properly (manual kerning).
In other cases you may have to add an '8' to fill the gap between
the two letters.  In any case, always leave a minimum of two spaces
between the letters (except where they actually touch). This appear
to give the best results.

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
16    - height of a character
10    - height of a character, not including descenders
25   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
0   - default smushmode for this font
32   - number of comment lines

const O8 = `flf2a$ 6 5 16 0 14
Original font by Gordon Lee <93cmgl@eng.cam.ac.uk>
==================================================
Original figletization by Tony Nugent (T.Nugent@sct.gu.edu.au)
Version 1  - Needs refining with hardblanks and cleaning up of some of
the characters.  The last 6 chars need to be done properly.
==================================================
Version 2 by Ian Chai <spectre@uiuc.edu> Added the hardblank fix and
the German characters.
==================================================

---

Font modified June 17, 2007 by patorjk 
This was to widen the space character.

const OS2 = `flf2a$ 7 7 20 1 19
os2.flf (FIGlet font)


By Kent Nassen, knassen@umich.edu, 4/30/95.

Looks like some sigs are still good for a few figlet font ideas.
This one's rather simplistic, I guess, but interesting nonetheless.
Thought I'd make a figlet font out of it.  Along the "lines" of bright,
relief, and contrast...

const Octal = `flf2a$ 1 1 11 -1 12 0

octal.flf by Karlton Wirsing based on
binary.flf (C) 1994 by Victor Parada (vparada@inf.utfsm.cl) 94/12/05

figlet 2.1 font, includes ISO Latin-1, excludes "-D" option chars.

Spaces are not shown as binary.  If this is required, change "$@" below
to "20 @".  Change to "@" to remove the hardspace between words.
Note that figlet always removes spaces when it moves words to a new line.

Try option "-m 0" to remove the space between letters (octets).

const Ogre = `flf2a$ 6 5 20 15 13
Standard by Glenn Chappell & Ian Chai 3/93 -- based on .sig of Frank Sheeran
Figlet release 2.0 -- August 5, 1993

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
20   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
13   - number of comment lines

`

const PatorjkHeX = `flf2a$ 12 10 40 0 10
"Patorjk-HeX" font by patorjk (patorjk@gmail.com) and HeX.

This font is my monospaced interpretation of (the very cool) HeX's AOL Font. 
I tried to make it look as close as possible to the original font (which was 
done in Arial). 

For this FIGlet version, I've re-done the letters in a monospaced fashion and 
added a period. I hope to add other characters later on, so this font can be 
seen as a work in progress.

const PatorjksCheese = `flf2a$ 14 10 40 0 8
"Patorjk's Cheese" font by patorjk (patorjk@gmail.com) and x98.

This font is my monospaced interpretation of x98's amazing Cheese AOL font. 

For this FIGlet version, I've re-done the letters in a monospaced fashion and 
added a period. I hope to add other characters later on, so this font can be 
seen as a work in progress.

const Pebbles = `flf2a$ 10 8 16 -1 7
Pebbles, figletized by Empath <hades@u.washington.edu> 7/94
completed by Ryan Youck (youck@cs.uregina.ca) 8/94
~From: flee@cse.psu.edu (Felix Lee)
Here's an ascii font I've been working on.  I started with the idea of
using bubbles (. o O) to build a font, using the motif .oOo. to
express a curve.  When I sketched out the lowercase letters, it ended
up looking more like pebbles than bubbles, so I renamed it.

const Poison = `flf2a$ 12 10 20 -1 14
poison.flf composed into figlet by Vinney Thai <ssfiit@eris.cc.umb.edu>
poison font (numbers & puntuation marks) composed by Vinney Thai
poison font (uppercase characters) composed David Issel <dissel@nunic.nu.edu>
date: Oct 23, 1994
Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
12   - height of a character
10   - height of a character, not including descenders
20   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 0" on command line)
15   - number of comment lines

                  "Red Phoenix" font by Red Phoenix
                 ====================================


-> Conversion to FigLet font by MEPH. (Part of ASCII Editor Service Pack I)
   (http://studenten.freepage.de/meph/ascii/ascii/editor/_index.htm)
-> Defined: ASCII code alphanumeric + most used symbols


ScarecrowsASCIIArtArchive
From: Purdie@zeus.usq.edu.au (Red Phoenix)
[Here's a nice font, which I've used (in a modified form) for one of my sigs.]

---

Font modified June 17, 2007 by patorjk 
I changed the "smushing" rules from the original font, so the letters would
fit together.

const Runic = `flf2a$ 6 6 15 -1 19
The elder futhark  -- by Bryan Alexander
(alexande@mathcs.rhodes.edu)
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
This font consists of the runes in the elder futhark.  It is accurate as
far as I know.  Any corrections, or ideas on improving the font's appearance
are welcome.  Modifying this font is fine with me; please e-mail me the
result.


Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
6    - height of a character, not including descenders
15   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font
19   - number of comment lines

const Runyc = `flf2a$ 6 6 15 -1 20
The elder futhark  -- by Bryan Alexander <alexande@mathcs.rhodes.edu>
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
This font consists of the runes in the elder futhark.  It is accurate as
far as I know.  Any corrections, or ideas on improving the font's appearance
are welcome.  Modifying this font is fine with me; please e-mail me the
result.

3 point version of the runes used as uppercase added as lowercase letters
9/22/97 Jerrad Pierce <belg4mit@mit.edu>

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
6    - height of a character, not including descenders
15   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font
20   - number of comment lines

const SLScript = `flf2a$ 6 4 20 0 13

Based on cursive(6) by Jan Wolter     <janc@crim.eecs.umich.edu> on 24 Jul 1985
Figlet-ized and     by Wendell Hicken <whicken@parasoft.com>     on  5 Mar 1994
    Added missing punctuation and numbers
Ammended            by Jerrad Pierce  <jpierce@cpan.org>         on  8 Aug 2002
    Underscore and dash have been updated to more closely match cursive(6)

       The  '_' character is treated in a special way.  It may be
       inserted in the text anywhere you wish to lengthen a  con-
       necting line between two letters.
       
Changed 2004-02-18: Bugfix in '-' character by Markus Gebhard
Changed 2012-05-21: Update to '-' character by patorjk

const Script = `flf2a$ 7 5 16 0 10 0 3904 96
Script by Glenn Chappell 4/93
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

const Shadow = `flf2a$ 5 4 16 0 14 0 4992
Shadow by Glenn Chappell 6/93 -- based on Standard & SmShadow
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

---

Font modified June 17, 2007 by patorjk 
This was to widen the space character.

const Shimrod = `flf2a$ 6 5 13 15 13
HHscript by Shimrod (Herman Hiddema), based on his own .sig
Figlet release 2.0 -- August 5, 1993

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
15   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
13   - number of comment lines

const Slant = `flf2a$ 6 5 16 15 10 0 18319
Slant by Glenn Chappell 3/93 -- based on Standard
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

const Slide = `flf2a. 6 5 15 0 10

slide.flf (C) 1994 by Victor Parada (vparada@inf.utfsm.cl) 94/08/18.

Looks nice in some kind of screens and paper.
Feel free to replace "#", "H" and "|" to some other chars.

Try option "-m -1" to disable smush and get clear fonts.

Latin fonts a' e' i' o' u' n~ and N~ replaces A" O" U" a" o" u" and B.

const Small = `flf2a$ 5 4 13 15 10 0 22415
Small by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- based on Standard
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

Downsized version of isometric1.flf - M. Lindsey (mglindse@nyx.cs.du.edu)
February 24, 1996
---
isometric1.flf

Figlet conversion by Kent Nassen (kentn@cyberspace.org), 8-10-94, based
on the fonts posted by Lennert Stock:

From: stock@fwi.uva.nl (Lennert Stock)
Date: 15 Jul 1994 00:04:25 GMT

Here are some fonts. Non-figlet I'm afraid, if you wanna convert them, be
my guest. I posted the isometric fonts before.

const SmallPoison = `flf2a$ 7 5 16 -1 14
smpoison.flf figletized by Vinney Thai <ssfiit@eris.cc.umb.edu>
poison font composed David Issel <dissel@nunic.nu.edu>
date: Nov 18, 1994

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
7    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
16   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 0" on command line)
14   - number of comment lines

const SmallScript = `flf2a$ 5 4 13 0 10 0 3904 96
SmScript by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- based on Script
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

SmShadow by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- based on Small
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

const SmallSlant = `flf2a$ 5 4 14 15 10 0 22415
SmSlant by Glenn Chappell 6/93 - based on Small & Slant
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

smisome1.flf
Downsized version of isometric1.flf - M. Lindsey (mglindse@nyx.cs.du.edu)
February 24, 1996
---
isometric1.flf

Figlet conversion by Kent Nassen (kentn@cyberspace.org), 8-10-94, based
on the fonts posted by Lennert Stock:

From: stock@fwi.uva.nl (Lennert Stock)
Date: 15 Jul 1994 00:04:25 GMT

Here are some fonts. Non-figlet I'm afraid, if you wanna convert them, be
my guest. I posted the isometric fonts before.

const Smpoison = `flf2a$ 7 5 16 -1 14
smpoison.flf figletized by Vinney Thai <ssfiit@eris.cc.umb.edu>
poison font composed David Issel <dissel@nunic.nu.edu>
date: Nov 18, 1994

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
7    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
16   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 0" on command line)
14   - number of comment lines

const Smscript = `flf2a$ 5 4 13 0 10 0 3904
SmScript by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- based on Script
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

SmShadow by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- based on Small
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

const Smslant = `flf2a$ 5 4 14 15 10 0 22415
SmSlant by Glenn Chappell 6/93 - based on Small & Slant
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

const Speed = `flf2a$ 6 5 16 15 16
Speed by Claude Martins 2/95 -- based on Slant
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
14   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font
16   - number of comment lines

const Standard = `flf2a$ 6 5 16 15 13 0 24463 229
Standard by Glenn Chappell & Ian Chai 3/93 -- based on Frank's .sig
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Modified for figlet 2.2 by John Cowan <cowan@ccil.org>
  to add Latin-{2,3,4,5} support (Unicode U+0100-017F).
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.

Font modified May 20, 2012 by patorjk to add the 0xCA0 character

const Tengwar = `flf2a$ 10 6 21 0 16
Tengwar 1.0 figlet by Belinda Asbell <mba@ccd.harris.com>
Adapted from Mike Urban's <urban@sideshow.jpl.nasa.gov> Tengwar for 
Metafont (which is, in turn, based on Tolkien :)
Date: 28 Feb 1996

Explanation of first line:  <copied from other figs>
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
10   - height of a character
6    - height of a character, not including descenders
21   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
0   - default smushmode for this font
16   - number of comment lines
NOTE: Substitutions: 'kh' for q, 'zh' for x, 'ch' for c.

const ThreePoint = `flf2a$ 3 2 11 0 14
threepoint by Randall Ransom 4/94 <ransom@girtab.usc.edu>
Figlet release 2.0 -- August 5, 1993
Date: 9 Apr 1994

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
3    - height of a character
2    - height of a character, not including descenders
11   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
0    - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 0" on command line)
14   - number of comment lines

const TinkerToy = `flf2a$ 7 5 12 -1 12
Tinker-toy by Wendell Hicken 11/93 (whicken@parasoft.com)

Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
7    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
5    - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
12   - number of comment lines

const Weird = `flf2a$ 6 5 10 0 13
weird.flf (version 2)
by:  Bas Meijer   meijer@info.win.tue.nl   bas@damek.kth.se
fixed by: Ryan Youck   youck@cs.uregina.ca
some special characters '#%*' etc. are not matching, they are from other fonts.
Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
20   - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
15   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
13   - number of comment lines

here's something i diddled up while wasting time at work..
if anyone wants to do something like figletize it (because i have no idea

i call it whimsy-- please keep the name, if you do turn it into a figlet
font. :)
